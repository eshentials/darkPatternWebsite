# Experimental Task Ground Truth

This document defines the fixed task flow and the exact dark patterns used for behavioral analysis.

| Task Number | Static Dark Pattern | Temporal Dark Pattern | Manipulative Choice | User-Beneficial Choice |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 | Visual Salience Bias (large centered “Buy Now”) | False Urgency Timer (“Offer expires in 02:59”) | Click “Buy Now” immediately | View details and compare alternatives |
| Task 2 | Preselected Add-Ons (engraving/refill pack checked) | Time-Pressured Modal (auto-advance after 5s) | Proceed with add-ons included | Manually uncheck add-ons |
| Task 3 | Confirmshaming (opt-out text: “No, I don't want to save money”) | Sequential Pressure (progress “Step 2 of 2 – Almost Done!”) | Accept subscription | Decline subscription |
| Task 4 | Hidden Opt-Out (“Cancel Subscription” under expandable menu) | Asymmetric Friction (3 screens with delay) | Pause subscription | Fully cancel subscription |
| Task 5 | Privacy Zuckering (vague labels, toggles ON) | Forced Decision Timer (Continue disabled 10s unless all ON) | Leave all toggles enabled | Disable non-essential data sharing |
| Task 6 | Hidden Costs (shipping/handling revealed only final page) | Exit Interruption (exit popup warning) | Confirm order without review | Review breakdown or abandon flow |
